# Tanawha Hiking Trail during Covid
This is a personal hike of the Tanawha Trail on the Parkway. During Covid, social distance was neccessary to stop the spread and one of the best ways to stay active were goig on hikes.
Articles have come out during Covid saying that hiking is a great way to get exercise while staying away from people. It is also a great form of meditation for people as well.
Here is an article from the Greensboro News talking about hiking, [Greensboro News](https://greensboro.com/entertainment/get-outside-you-can-social-distance-on-the-parkway-and-have-your-views-too/article_6c13419d-6893-5f40-af38-c170abbcd356.html)

This is a trail map of part of the Tanawha Trail. This section was only from Price Lake to Linn Cove Viaduct. You can continue towards Stack Rock and Beacon Heights to finish the Tanawha Trail. 
Sections above the Viaduct and along Rough Ridge are strenuous, but overall the trail is an easy to moderate walk. The many accesses from the parkway let hikers choose as long a section as they like. To preserve this delicate area, stay on designated paths, bridges, and boardwalks.

To make this web map, [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) was used to get the base data route for the hike. [Maps to GPX](https://mapstogpx.com/) was then used to convert the google maps data into a gpx file.[GeoJSON.io](http://geojson.io/#map=2/20.0/0.0) was then used to convert the gpx file into a geojson file which was then used to make the web map for this article.
